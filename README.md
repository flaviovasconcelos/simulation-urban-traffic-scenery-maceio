Documentation of the article "An Urban Traffic Optimization Approach Using Simulation Strategy" for IEEE Latin America.

This code can be used to carry out urban traffic for a road in the city of Macei√≥ Alagoas, Brazil. The chosen scenario was Avenida Fernandes Lima as it represents one of the most important avenues in the city. The proposed model allows us to understand the behavior of the flow of vehicles on the road that has peculiarities such as the blue lane (exclusive for public transport) and three sections with pedestrian traffic lights.

With the proposed model, it is possible to implement possible road interventions, such as the removal time of traffic lights from vehicles, reducing the increase in vehicle flow, fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
