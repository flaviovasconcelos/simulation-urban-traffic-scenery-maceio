Documentation of the article "Performance Evaluation of Urban Traffic Using Simulation: A Case Study in Brazil" for IEEE Latin America.

This code can be used to carry out urban traffic for a road in the city of Macei√≥, State of Alagoas, Brazil. The chosen scenario was Avenida Fernandes Lima as it represents one of the most important avenues in the city. The proposed model allows us to understand the behavior of the flow of vehicles on the road that has peculiarities such as the blue lane (exclusive for public transport) and three sections with pedestrian traffic lights.

#With the proposed model, it is possible to implement possible road interventions, such as the removal time of traffic lights from vehicles, reducing the increase in #vehicle flow, fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

With the proposed model, it is possible to implement interventions on the avenue, such as the removal of traffic lights, removal of the exclusive lane for public transport and adjustment in the time of the traffic light cycle, aiming to improve the volume of vehicle traffic,
as well as reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
